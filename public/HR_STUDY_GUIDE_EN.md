- ✓ Clear career paths
- ✓ Efficient resource utilization

**Disadvantages:**

- ✓ Flexibility

**Disadvantages:**

- ✗ No economies of scale
- ✗ Competition between divisions

## ⚡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (17.5% of Points)

---

## 4. PERSONNEL PLANNING & FTE (8 Points)

### FTE Calculation Formula

```
FTE = Workload (hours) / Available hours per person
```

**Components:**
- Workload = Number of tasks × Time per task
- Available = Working days × Hours/day × Utilization

### Exam Example: QuickDrop Logistics

**Given:**
- 4 million packages/year
- 4 min/package
- 80% utilization

**Assumptions (ALWAYS state!):**
- 250 working days/year
- 8 hours/day = 2,000 hours/year

**Calculation:**
```
Workload: 4,000,000 × 4 min = 16,000,000 min = 266,667 hours
Available: 2,000 × 0.8 = 1,600 hours
FTE = 266,667 / 1,600 = 167 employees
```

---

### Seasonality Management

**Situation:**
- December: +25%
- July/August: -10%

**Measure 1: Flexible Workforce**
"Fixed-term seasonal workers in December. Partner with staffing agencies. Early recruitment from October."

**Measure 2: Variable Working Hours**
"Working time accounts: Build up overtime in December, reduce in summer. 4-day week in July/August."

**Other Options:**
- Student helpers
- Vacation planning
- Outsourcing peak volumes

**Unsuitable:**
- ✗ Power ≠ Saving (wrong connection)
- ✗ Strong independence contradicts close contact

### Span of Control

**Definition:** Number of employees directly reporting

**SMALLER Span needed when:**
- Complex tasks
- New employees

---

## 11. PERSONNEL SELECTION MISTAKES

### First Order Mistake (Alpha Error / Type I)
