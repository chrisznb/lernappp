"The three product categories (Home Care, Body Care, Dietary Supplements) have different customers, distribution channels, and requirements. A divisional structure enables product-specific marketing and specialized sales strategies."

Reasoning CONTRA:
"Duplication of functions like marketing and sales leads to higher costs and loses synergies in procurement and production that were utilized with the functional structure."',

- Unconscious bias in job descriptions
- Always the same universities/channels

Measures:
✓ Formulate job ads gender-neutral
✓ Use diverse recruitment channels (not just elite universities)
✓ Structured interviews instead of gut feeling
✓ Use diverse interview panels
✓ Blind recruiting (CVs without name/photo)
✓ Critically review job requirements (are 10 years of experience really necessary?)',

'Personnel Selection: Second Order Mistake (Beta Error)',
'**Second Order Mistake (Type II Error / Beta Error)**

Definition:
**REJECTING a SUITABLE candidate**
False Negative - "We rejected the right person"

**Exam Example: Statistics Professor FH Aachen**

"FH Aachen rejects a highly qualified female candidate for the statistics professorship because she seemed nervous in the presentation and didn''t attend an elite university. She later becomes a professor at a renowned university and wins several teaching awards. FH misses out on a star professor."

Consequences:
- Lost talent (goes to competition!)
- Opportunity costs
- Position must be filled again (time, costs)
- Less obvious than First Order Mistake
- "What could have been?"',

Stages:
1. **Aided Awareness** - Know the company
2. **Familiar** - Familiar with the company
3. **Shortlist** - On the application list
4. **Application** - Application submitted
5. **Preferred Employer** - Would want to work there

**Conversion Rates show where problems are:**

Example BroadBand:
- 90 → 33 (Familiar): 37% (weak!)
- 33 → 30 (Shortlist): 91%
- 30 → 80 (Application): Wait, that can''t be... 267%? Error in Exam
- 24 → 40 (Preferred): Again weird...
- 40 → 10 (Final): 25% (weak!)

Problem: BroadBand has poor conversion from Familiar to active applicants',

**Statements:**

APPLICABLE: "BroadBand''s biggest problem is proportion who want to work there if successful"
→ 40 reach Application, only 10 really want to work there (25%)

APPLICABLE: "BroadBand is more last resort compared to DeepStar"
→ See Preferred Employer Rate

NOT APPLICABLE: "DeepStar doesn''t do good job turning interested into employees"
→ DeepStar has 100% conversion from Application to Preferred!

APPLICABLE: "DeepStar performs better in all dimensions"
→ Higher conversion rates in all stages (except initial Awareness)',
